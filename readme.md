**AKA list of excuses**

Simple php/mySQL project, just created for practice

Front end is basic and not tested outside of Mac on Chrome. It should be fine though, except for form controls ... and we know how much fun they are to do from scratch ;)

# To do

- db creation script or make remote db with dummy data
- make dropdowns clear visually
- make log more usable (currently spits out raw seconds)
- paginate costs page
- alt theme for ui
- eye candy for ui
